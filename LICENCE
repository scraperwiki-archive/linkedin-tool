Short version: for normal people
--------------------------------

This tool's code is proprietary.

-------------------------

Unless otherwise stated, all the files in this directory and subdirectories of
it - referred to in this licence as "the files" - are Copyright (C) ScraperWiki
Ltd. The use of all the files is subject to the following non-exclusive
copyright licence.

[1] The files may be used only by an individual who has permission (under a
contract with ScraperWiki Ltd, either directly or via a third party such as the
individual's employer) to use a ScraperWiki tool or dataset or view with which
the files were supplied by ScraperWiki Ltd.

[2] The files may be used only as long as the permission mentioned in [1]
continues. If the relevant contract with ScraperWiki Ltd ends (for whatever
reason) all permissions under this licence are withdrawn.

[3] On any ScraperWiki Ltd server, the files may be copied, viewed, edited,
executed or otherwise used for their intended purpose; provided that no copies
of any of the files, or any adaptation of any of the files, is made on any
machine other than a ScraperWiki Ltd server.

[4] The files may be copied by an individual who has permission (under [1]
above) to a computer under that individual's control provided that they are all
deleted once the permission ends.

On that computer, the files may be copied, viewed, edited, executed or
otherwise used for their intended purpose; provided that no copies of any of
the files, or any adaptation of any of the files, is made on any machine other
than a ScraperWiki Ltd server or that computer itself.

[5] The files may not be used in any other way.

[6] In this licence "adaptation" has the same meaning as in the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act 1988.

[7] If ScraperWiki Ltd ceases to operate a service upon which any of the files
may be run and no equivalent service is offered by a ScraperWiki operator, then
any file affected is licensed to any individual who had permission under [1]
above immediately prior to the cessation, under the Simplified BSD License.

Where:
 
"equivalent service" includes (a) a situation where one or more of the files
are replaced by other files offering at least broadly similar functionality;
and (b) the operation of a different service on which the files may be run; or
(c) both (a) and (b) at the same time.
 
"ScraperWiki operator" means ScraperWiki Ltd and any of its successors or
assigns.

[8] This licence is to be construed in accordance with the law of England.
